## Description
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz
 

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

## Algorithm
We can find the length of the ll first and then delete the node by finding the position of the node to be deleted. This will result in a constant space complexity and O(N) time complexity. But in worse case, we will have to traverse the ll twice, one for finding the length, and then to delete the node.

We can solve this problem in only one pass using two pointer approach. In this approach we keep slow pointer n nodes behind the fast pointer. That way when the fast pointer reaches the last node, the slow pointer is on the node just behind the node to which needs to be deleted.

## Code
```cpp
ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
    ListNode *slow, *fast;
	slow = nullptr;
    fast = head;
    int position = 1;
    while (fast->next != nullptr) {
        fast = fast->next;
        if (position > n) slow = slow->next;
        else if (position == n) slow = head;
        position++;
    }

    if (slow == nullptr) return head->next;

    slow->next = slow->next->next;
    return head;
}
```

## Complexities
Time - O(N)
Space - O(1)
