## 2. Web Application Basics
Three things that we need for a basic web app:
1. Handler. Function that executes your business logic and writes http response headers & bodies.
2. Router(servemux in Go terminology). Stores a mapping between the URL patterns & the corresponding handlers.
3. Web Server.

```go
import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func home(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) { // handler
	w.Write([]byte("Hello from snippetbox."))
}

func main() {
	mux := http.NewServeMux() // servemux
	mux.HandleFunc("/", home) // mapping "/" to home handler

	log.Println("Server running on port :4000")
	err := http.ListenAndServe(":4000", mux) // creating a web server
	log.Fatal(err)
}

```
Go's servemux treats "/" as a catch-all. So at this moment all the HTTP requests will be handled by home function.

### Additional Information
#### Network Addresses
The TCP network address that you pass to `http.ListenAndServe()` should be in format `"host:port"`. If you omit the host then the server will listen on all your computer's available network interfaces.
The port can also be named like `":http"` or `":http-alt"` instead of a number. Go attempt to look the port number from your `/etc/services` file when starting the server, or return an error if a match can't be found.

## 3. Routing Requests
### Fixed Path and Subtree Patterns
Fixed path don't have a trailing `/` while subtree patterns do.
A fixed path's handler is called only when the URL path exactly matches the fixed path.
A subtree patterm's handler is called if the start of the URL path matches the subtree pattern. This explains why `/` acts as a catch-all.

```go
/*
every request which start with /snippet/view will be matched with this handler
*/
mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/view/", snippetView)
/*
only request /snippet/create will be matched with this handler
*/
mux.HandleFunc("/snippet/create", snippetCreate)
```

### The `DefaultServeMux`
You can don't need to create a servemux as there exists a `DefaultServeMux` which is stores in `net/http` global variable.
Here is the line from the GO source code
```go
var DefaultServeMux = NewServeMux()
```
But this is dangerous. As it is global variable any package can access it and register a route, even third-party packages. If any of those third-party packages are compromised, they could register a malicious route.

### Additional Information
#### Servemux features & quirks
- In GO, longer URL patterns takes precedence over shorter ones.
- Request URL paths are automatically sanitized.
- If a subtree pattern has been registered and the request is received for that subtree path without the trailing `/`, then the user will be automatically be sent to `301 Permanent Redirect` to the subtree path with slash added.

#### Host name matching
It's possible to include host names in your URL.
```go
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.HandleFunc("foo.example.org/", fooHandler)
mux.HandleFunc("bar.example.org/", barHandler)
mux.HandleFunc("/baz", bazHandler)
```

## 4. Customizing HTTP headers
### HTTP status codes
```go
w.WriteHeader(405)
```
- You can only call `w.WriteHeader()` once per response. 
- The first call to `w.Write()` send a `200 OK` status code. So if you want to send a different status code, call `w.WriteHeader()` before calling `w.Write()`.

### Customizing headers
```go
w.Header().Set("Allow", "POST")
```
Changing the response header map after a call to w.WriteHeader() or w.Write() will have no effect on the headers that the user receives. You need to make sure that your response header map contains all the headers you want before you call these methods.

### The `http.Error` shortcut
```go
http.Error(w, "Method Not Allowed", 405)
```
This is a helper method which takes in a writer, message and a status code & calls the `WriteHeader()` and `Write()` method on the writer.

### The `net/http` constants
There exists named constants for http method names and status codes on `http` package. Use them to avoid typos.

### Additional Information
#### System-generated headers and content sniffing
When sending a response GO automatically send three system-generated headers for you: `Date`, `Content-Length`, `Content-Type`.
`Content-Type` is detected using the `http.DetectContentType()` method, if it can't guess the type, it defaults to `application/octet-stream`.
This function can't distinguish JSON from plain text. So in that case you should type yourself otherwise it will set it to `text/plain; charset=utf-8`.

#### Manipulating the header map
#notunderstood 
#### Header canonicalization
#notunderstood 
#### Suppressing system-generated headers
The Del() method doesn’t remove system-generated headers.
You need to directly modify the underlying header map.
```go
w.Header()["Date"] = nil
```

## 5. URL query strings
You can get the query parameter using 
```go
r.URL.Query().Get("id") 
// get the query param "id"
// if the query param doesn't exist, empty string is returned 
```

### The `io.writer` interface
You can pass the `http.ResponseWriter` anywhere `io.Writer` is expected as it `http.ResponseWriter` satisfies the `io.Writer` interface.

## 6. Project structure and organization
There is no single right or recommended structure in GO.
The structure used in this project is
```
.
├── cmd
│  └── web
│     ├── handlers.go
│     └── main.go
├── go.mod
├── internal
└── ui
   ├── html
   └── static
```

- cmd => will contain the application specific code for the executable application in the project.
- internal => non-application specific code
- ui => user interface assets like html, css, images etc.

### Advantages of this structure
1. All the GO and non-GO is separated. It makes things easier to manage when it comes to building and deploying your application.
2. It scales nicely if you want to add another executable application to your project as you can just create a folder under cmd directory and you can use the internal directory code.

### Additional Information
#### The internal directory
Directory named `internal` carries a special meaning and behaviour in GO: any packages which live under this directory can only be imported by code inside the parent of the internal directory.

## 7. HTML templating and inheritance
To use templating in GO, create a template file. The extension of file can be anything.
```go
// reads the template file into a template set
ts, err := template.ParseFiles("./ui/html/pages/home.tmpl")
// writes the template content as the response body
err = ts.Execute(w, nil)
```

### Template composition
```go
// this defines a new template named "name"
{{define "name" }}
	...
{{end}}
```

```go
... 
// this invokes the template named "name"
// the dot represents any dynamic data that you want to pass to the template
{{template "name" .}}
...
```

```go
files := []string{
"./ui/html/base.tmpl",
"./ui/html/pages/home.tmpl",
}
ts, err := template.ParseFiles(files...)
// we are writing the template named "base"
err = ts.ExecuteTemplate(w, "base", nil)
```

### Embedding partials
For some applications you might want to break out certain bits of HTML into partials that can be reused in different pages or layouts. The process is same as template composition.

### Additional information
#### The block action
if the block names "name" exist then it is used, else the content inside is used. If a template doesn't exist an error is returned from `ts.ExecuteTemplate()`, while there is no error in the case of block.
```go
{{block "name" .}}
// optional 
{{end}}
```

#### Embedding files
Go 1.16 introduced the `embed` package which makes it possible to embed files into your GO program itself rather than reading them from disk.

## 8. Serving static files
### The `http.Fileserver` handler
You can use the `net/http`'s `http.Fileserver` to serve files from a specific folder.
```go
fileServer := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./ui/static"))
mux.Handle("/static/", http.StripPrefix("/static", fileServer))
```
When this handler receives a request it will remove the leading slash from the URL and then search the `.ui/static` directory for corresponding files. You use `http.StripPrefix` to strip prefix.

### Using the static files
You can use the static files inside html.

### Additional Information
#notunderstood 

## 9. The `http.Handler` interface
A handler is a object which satisfies the `http.Handler` interface.
```go
type Handler interface {
	ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request)
}
```

```go
type home struct {}
func (h *home) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	w.Write([]byte("This is my home page"))
}
// using the handler
mux := http.NewServeMux()
mux.Handle("/", &home{})
```

### Handler functions
```go
http.HandlerFunc(home) // convert a function to Handler by adding the ServeHTTP method
mux.HandleFunc("/", home) // convert the home function to Handler
```

### Chaining handlers
The `http.ListenAndServe` function also takes a `Handler` as the second parameter.
```go
func ListenAndServe(addr string, handler Handler) error
```
But we were passing our serveMux as the second paramater. We were able to do that because it has a `ServeHTTP` method thus satisfying the `Handler` interface.
It simplifies things to think of the servemux as just being a special kind of handler, which instead of providing a response itself passes the request on to a second handler.

### Requests are handled concurrently
*All HTTP requests are served in their own goroutines*. So be aware of **race conditions**.
