# Feeling Good The New Mood Therapy Revised and Updated
## 5. Do-Nothingism: How to Beat It
-  changing your behavior will help you feel better about yourself if it exerts a positive influence on the way you are thinking.
### Why We Procrastinate?
#### 1. Hopelessness
- Any activity seems pointless because you are certain than your lack of motivation and sense of oppression are unending and irreversible. 
#### 2. Helplessness
- You can't possibly do anything to help yourself because you are convinced your moods are caused by factors beyond your control, such as fate, dietary factors, luck and other people's evaluations of you.
#### 3. Overwhelming Yourself
- You may overwhelm yourself by:
	- magnifying a task to degree that it seems impossible to tackle
	- assuming that you must do everything at once
	- distracting yourself from the task at hand by obsessing about endless other things you haven't gotten around to doing yet.
#### 4. Jumping To Conclusions
- Assume that the task will not result in satisfaction
#### 5. Self-labeling
- You label yourself as "procrastinator" so you automatically expect little or nothing from yourself.
#### 6. Undervaluing the Rewards
- You think that rewards wouldn't be worth the effort.
- You always finds a way to discredit your efforts.
#### 7. Perfectionism
- You will only do work with perfection so you end up doing nothing.
#### 8. Fear of Failure
- You imagine that putting in the effort and not succeeding would be an overwhelming personal defeat, you refuse to try at all.
- Several thinking errors are involved
	- overgeneralization : "if i fail it this, it means I will fail at anything."
	- evaluating your performance exclusively on the outcome regardless of your effort.
#### 9. Fear of Success
#### 10. Fear of Disapproval & Criticism
#### 11. Coercion and Resentment
#### 12. Low Frustration Tolerance
#### 13. Guilt and Self-blame
### Weapons Against Procrastination
#### The Daily Activity Schedule
- This schedule consist of two columns. 
- First is **perspective** column, in which you will write what you want to accomplish each day hour-by-hour.
- Second is **retrospective** column, in which at the end of the day you record what you did in the each time slot.
- Label whatever you did as M for mastery or P for pleasure. Mastery activities are those which represents some accomplishments. Also give each activity rating based on how pleasurable or difficult it was. Give 5 for the most difficult or pleasurable activities. An activity can have both M & P.
- As you plan you day, develop a balanced program that provides for enjoyable leisure activities as well as work.
- As you continue planning each day, schedule high scoring activities more & more.
#### The Antiprocrastination Sheet
- Write down task that you have been putting of in a column.
	- If the task requires substantial time and effort, it is best to break it down into a series of small steps so that each one can be completed in fifteen minutes or less.
- In the next column write down what you predict the difficulty of task will be on the scale of 0-100 percent scale.
- In the next column write down how satisfying & rewarding you think the task is going to be on a scale of 0-100 percent.
- After you have completed the task, take note of how difficult it actually turned out to be, as well as the amount of pleasure you gained from doing it.
