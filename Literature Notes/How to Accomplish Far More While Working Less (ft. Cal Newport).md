# How to Accomplish Far More While Working Less (ft. Cal Newport)
- Slow productivity is needed because nowadays we have limitless oppurtunities at each moment to be productive, which drives us insane.
- There is an ambiguity in defining the productivity of knowledge work.
- In slow productivity the metric that defines your productivity is not what you did on a particular day, instead it is measured on a large timescale.
	- Give time things that they deserve.
- **Slow Productivity vs Procrastination**
	- In slow productivity it is recommended to take a deadline longer than the one you initially thought of, but that doesn't mean you should procrastinate on it, instead you should set mini milestones. 
- **Do fewer things, at once**
	- That doesn't mean you should work less, instead it means that you should work on fewer things so that your rate of completion increases.
	- Doing more things hinders your rate of completion because every thing have a overhead associated with it like meetings, and it fragments your focus.
- There is a cost in context switching.

## Cal's Tip To Avoid Burnout
- **Be Transparent About What You Are Working On**
	- Have a shared document in which you have two sections, first the 3 things on which you are currently working, and second will the queue section in which you have all the things you will do after you complete one of the task in the first list.
- **Push vs Pull System**
	- In push systems, the work is assigned to a worker as soon as it requires, while in pull system, worker himself ask for work.
	- In push systems work tends to pile up, while in pull system the speed of the whole chain gets slowed down to the speed of the slowest worker. The advantage of pull system is that you can then identify which is your slowest worker/step and if needed assign more workers to it.
- **Work at a Natural Pace**
	- You work at a natural pace when you obsess over quality.
- ==Improve the quality of the skills which will make you move up the career ladder==. Don't become good at bunch of small things that don't make you grow in your career because if you do become good in those, you will be stuck in doing just those.
