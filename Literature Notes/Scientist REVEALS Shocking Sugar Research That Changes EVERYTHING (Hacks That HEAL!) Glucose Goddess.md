# Scientist REVEALS Shocking Sugar Research That Changes EVERYTHING (Hacks That HEAL!) Glucose Goddess
- The best time to eat sugar for maximum pleasure and less impact on your health is after a meal. Don't eat sugar as snack, on empty stomach or in the morning. The reason being is that sugar causes a quick glucose spike followed by a crash.
- Don't eat carbs alone. If you want to eat carbs, eat them with protein, fats or fiber. This way carbs gets digested slowly and don't cause such a quick glucose spike.
- Glucose spikes causes aging. Aging is caused by glycation and glucose spikes leads to glycation.
	- Solution -> Don't spike your glucose level unnecessary.
- Four hacks
	1. Savoury breakfast instead of sugary -> so that your glucose levels don't have a big spike and you don't get distracted in a day
	2. Vinegar before carbs -> it slows down the digestion of carbs -> drink one spoon of vinegar in a glass of water before a carb eating
	3. Vegetable Starter -> vegetable have fiber. Fiber creates a lining on your intestine and so the other food doesn't come in contact with blood that often.
	4. Moving after eating -> every cell in your body uses glucose. So does muscles. If you move after eating, you are essentially burning glucose.
- Cortisol level rise also cause glucose level spike. Back in the day, when we saw a lion, our cortisol level rise, so in order to flee the scene, our body will release glucose from our liver into our bloodstream, thus causing glucose level spike.
- You health both physical and mental is affected by what you eat. What you eat affects your enzymes and hormones which in turn affect your health, physical as well as mental.
- The best breakfast is a breakfast that is built around protein.
- Symptoms are messages from your body. Listen to them and understand what they are trying to tell you.
