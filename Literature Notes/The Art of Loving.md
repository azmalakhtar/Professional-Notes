# The Art of Loving

## Is Love an Art?
> Then it requires knowledge and effort.

- The attitudes that prevent us from trying to learn about how to love are
##### Most people see the problem of love primarily as that of being loved, rather than that of loving, of one's capacity to love.
##### Assumption that the problem of love is the problem of an object, not the problem of a faculty.
- In older time, love was supposed to develop once the marriage had been concluded. With the introduction of romantic love, love is supposed to be there before marriage. This new concept greatly enhances the importance of the object as against the important of function.
- Love is an art, no doubt.But object matters in art too. A bad instrument will lead to a bad music regardless of how good skillful a  musician is. Every object has an upper and lower bound of the art that you can produce. By improving your skill you might be able to achieve the highest level of art that you can from that particular object but it's the object that fix that upper limit. #self
##### Confusion between the initial experience of "falling" in love, and the permanent state of being in love
-  they take the intensity of the infatuation, this being “crazy” about each other, for proof of the intensity of their love, while it may only prove the degree of their preceding loneliness

### Necessary Steps in Learning Any Art
1. Mastery of Theory
2. Mastery of Practice
3. Intuition
