# 1 Introduction
## 1.1 What Operating Systems Do
- A computer system can be roughly divided into four components: the hardware, the operating system, the application programs, and a user.
- An operating system is similar to a government, it performs no useful function by itself, it simply provides an environment within which other programs can do useful work.
- Operating System provide following
	- ease of use
	- resource(hardware) allocation
- There is no universally accepted definition of what is part of operating system.
- A common definition is that the operating system is the one program running at all times on the computer-usually called the **kernel**. Along with kernel, there are two other types of programs: system programs, which are associated with the operating system but are not necessarily part of the kernel, and application programs, which include all programs not associated with the operation of the system.
- Mobile operating system often include not only a core kernel but also **middleware**-a set of software frameworks that provide additional services to application developers.
