## 1. Managing configuration settings
It is a good idea to keep configuration separate from the code, as you might need different configuration for development, testing and production environments.
### Command line flags
```go
addr := flag.String("addr", ":4000", "HTTP network address")
flag.Parse()
```

```cmd
$ go run ./cmd/web -addr=":9999"
2022/01/29 15:50:20 Starting server on :9999
```

> [!warning]
> Port **0-1023** are restricted and (typically) can only be used by services which have root privileges. If you try any of these ports you should get a `bind: permission denied` error message on start-up.

### Default values
Command line flags are completely optional. If you don't pass them, flag fall back to default values.

### Type conversions
`flag.String()` converts whatever value the user provides at the runtime to string and if the value can't be converted to a string then the application will the log error and exit.
Go also has this for other types like `flag.Int()`, `flag.Bool()` etc.

### Automated help
Another great feature is that you can use the `-help` flag to list all the available command-line flags for an application and their accompanying help text.
```cmd
$ go run ./cmd/web -help
Usage of /tmp/go-build3672328037/b001/exe/web:
	-addr string
		HTTP network address (default ":4000")
```

### Additional Information
#### Environment variables
You can use environment variables in GO using:
```go
addr := os.Getenv("SNIPPETBOX_ADDR")
```
But this has some drawbacks compared to command line flags:
- You can't specify a default value.
- You don't get the `-help` flag functionality.
- The return value from `os.Getenv()` is always a string, you don't get automatic conversions.

Instead you can get the best of both worlds passing the environment variable as command line flag.
```cmd
$ export SNIPPETBOX_ADDR=":9999"
$ go run ./cmd/web -addr=$SNIPPETBOX_ADDR
2022/01/29 15:54:29 Starting server on :9999
```

#### Boolean flags
Omitting a boolean flag value is same as `-flag=true`

#### Pre-existing variables
It’s possible to parse command-line flag values into the memory
addresses of pre-existing variables, using the `flag.StringVar()` ,
`flag.IntVar()` , `flag.BoolVar()` and other functions.
```go
type config struct {
	addr string
	staticDir string
}
...
var cfg config
flag.StringVar(&cfg.addr, "addr", ":4000", "HTTP network address")
flag.StringVar(&cfg.staticDir, "static-dir", "./ui/static", "Path to static assets")
flag.Parse()
```

## 2. Leveled logging
You can create custom loggers using `log.New()`.
```go
infoLog := log.New(os.Stdout, "INFO\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime)
errorLog := log.New(os.Stderr, "ERROR\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime|log.Llongfile)

infoLog.Printf("Starting server on %s", *addr)
err := http.ListenAndServe(*addr, mux)
errorLog.Fatal(err)
```

### Decoupled logging
A big benefit of logging your messages to the standard streams is that your application and logging are decoupled. This allow you to handle logging differently depending on the environment.
In development you might want to see the logs on the terminal. While in the development environment you might want to write to files.
```cmd
$ go run ./cmd/web >>/tmp/info.log 2>>/tmp/error.log
```

### The `http.Server` error log
By default the if the `http.Server` encounters any error it writes to standard logger. To override this behaviour initialize a `http.Server` struct.
```go
srv := &http.Server{
	Addr:     *addr,
	ErrorLog: errorLog, // custom logger
	Handler:  mux,
}

err := srv.ListenAndServe() // using custom http.Server
```

### Additional information
#### Additional logging methods
You should avoid using the `Panic()` and `Fatal()` variations outside of your `main()` function.

#### Concurrent logging
Custom loggers created by `log.New()` are concurrency-safe.You can
share a single logger and use it across multiple goroutines and in your handlers without needing to worry about race conditions.

That said, if you have multiple loggers writing to the same destination then you need to be careful and ensure that the destination’s underlying `Write()` method is also safe for concurrent use.

#### Logging to a file
You can log directly to a file.
```go
f, err := os.OpenFile("/tmp/info.log", os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE, 0666)
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
defer f.Close()
infoLog := log.New(f, "INFO\t", log.Ldate|log.Ltime)
```
