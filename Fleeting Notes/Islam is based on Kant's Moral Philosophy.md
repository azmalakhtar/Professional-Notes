# Islam is based on Kant's Moral Philosophy
- In Islam it is said that we don't belong to ourselves, instead we all belong to Allah and that's why we can't do whatever we want with our ourselves. What [[Kant]] says in his moral philosophy is that **Don't treat people as mere means to an end**. 
- Islam mostly prohibites things that will make us treat ourselves as means to an end, like drinking wine because in that case we are treating our bodies as a mere means to feel a particular emotion etc.
