- Give women their dowries graciously. But if they willingly forego some of it, then consume it with enjoyment and pleasure. - 4:4
- And Whoever earns a sin, earns it against himself. God is Aware and Wise. - 4:111
- And whoever commits a mistake, or a sin, and then blames it on an innocent person, has taken a slander and a clear sin. - 4:112
- Whoever intercedes for a good cause has a share in it, and whoever intercedes for an evil cause shares in its burdens. God keeps watch over everything. - 4:85

- When you are greeted with a greeting, respond with a better greeting, or return it. God keeps count of everything. - 4:86
