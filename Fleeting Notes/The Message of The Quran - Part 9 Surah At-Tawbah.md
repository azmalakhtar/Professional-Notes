# The Message of The Quran - Part 9 Surah At-Tawbah
- Those who criticize the believers who give charity voluntarily, and ridicule those who find nothing to give except their own effortsâ€”God ridicules them. They will have a painful punishment. - 9:79
- Also towards the three who were left behind. Then, when the earth, as vast as it is, closed in on them, and their very souls closed in on them, and they realized that ==there was no refuge from God, except in Him==, He redeemed them, so that they may repent. God is the Redeemer, the Merciful. - 9:118
