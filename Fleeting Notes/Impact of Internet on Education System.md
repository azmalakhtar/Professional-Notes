### Objective
- To analyse the adverse impact of internet of education on the student's attitude and culture.
- Analysing both good and bad aspects of internet on learning

#### Good of Internet
- **Flexible Learning Opportunities**: Students have the flexibility to access learning materials at their convenience, allowing them to review content as needed for a more efficient learning experience. Learning can occur at any time that suits the individual, without being restricted to specific hours, enabling greater flexibility in scheduling.
- **Commute Free Education**: By removing the necessity for commuting, students are able to reclaim substantial amounts of time, which can then be redirected towards reinforcing their comprehension of the subject matter. This newfound surplus of time empowers students to allocate additional hours to solidify their grasp of the material, thus enhancing their overall learning experience and academic performance. 
- **Accessibility of Education**: In the pre-internet era, students were confined to physical classrooms, which greatly restricted their access to education. For many students residing in areas lacking quality educational institutions, this limitation posed significant challenges. However, with the advent of digital education, the necessity for physical presence in a classroom has been eliminated. This breakthrough ensures that students from any corner of the globe have equitable opportunities to pursue education, transcending geographical barriers and enabling access to learning resources on a global scale.
- **Personalized Learning**: Within digital education, learners have the ability to customize their learning experience. For instance, a student can adjust the lecture speed to match their comprehension level, accelerating through sections that are easily grasped while pausing at points requiring deeper understanding.
- **Reduced Cost**: Digital education offers cost advantages over traditional methods for two primary reasons. Firstly, the tuition expenses are typically lower owing to reduced infrastructure costs associated with physical classrooms. Additionally, learners can avoid supplementary expenses such as transportation, accommodation, and related overheads like textbooks and materials.
- **Mobile-Based Learning**: The prevalence of smartphones and mobile apps has made learning highly accessible and mobile-friendly. Students now have the ability to easily access educational content, participate in online courses, and engage in learning activities from their smartphones, enabling learning on the go. This convenience allows students to make productive use of their time, whether commuting or waiting, and integrates learning seamlessly into their daily lives.
- **Better Information Sharing**: Online platforms enable educators to share educational resources, lesson plans, and teaching materials more efficiently. They can collaborate with colleagues, share best practices, and access a wealth of educational content, enhancing the quality of instruction and learning outcomes.

#### Bad of Internet
- **Distractions**: In a traditional classroom setting, the primary focus is on educational activities. In contrast, the internet offers an expansive range of activities for engagement, leading to an increased potential for distractions.
- **Lack of Social Skills**: Classrooms are dynamic environments that extend beyond mere educational settings. They function as lively centers for social interaction, collaboration, and individual development. Through facilitating peer interaction, cultural exchange, relationship building, and the honing of social skills, classrooms are instrumental in nurturing students into holistic individuals poised for success in society. Conversely, digital education lacks these integral facets.
- **Lack of Interpersonal Relationship**: In the traditional education system, face-to-face interactions among students and between students and teachers foster deeper understanding and connection. This interpersonal engagement cultivates strong bonds between students and teachers. Conversely, digital education lacks such opportunities, hindering the development of robust interpersonal relationships.
- **Nearsightedness**: In digital education, students are required to continuously focus on screens, such as laptops, smartphones, or desktops. Unlike traditional education, which does not necessitate prolonged proximity to objects, this prolonged screen exposure increases the risk of myopia. Therefore, digital education poses a potential risk of myopia development for students.
- **Dress Codes and Personal Development**: In the traditional education system, students adhere to a specific dress code suitable for the learning environment. This practice instills the valuable skill of dressing appropriately, contributing to their overall development as well-rounded individuals. However, in digital education, students are not subject to such restrictions, thus missing out on the opportunity to acquire this essential skill.
- **Lack of Concentration**: The incessant bombardment of notifications, social media updates, and other online distractions poses a significant challenge to students' concentration on educational endeavors. This persistent disruption undermines their capacity to remain focused on academic tasks, leading to a decline in their overall academic performance and diminishing the effectiveness of their learning outcomes.
- **Declining of Reasoning Ability**: Relying heavily on search engines and abundant online information may hinder students' critical thinking and analytical skills. They may prioritize memorization over deeper understanding, impacting their ability to evaluate information critically and solve problems effectively.
