# The Message of The Quran - Part 5 Surah al-Māidah
- And let not the hatred of people who barred you from the Sacred Mosque incite you to aggression. - part of 5:2
	- act in just manner even if you have hatred towards a person
- And We wrote for them in it: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal wound for a wound; but whoever forgoes it in charity, it will serve as atonement for him. Those who do not rule according to what God revealed are the evildoers. - 5:45
- Permitted for you is the catch of sea, and its food—as sustenance for you and for travelers. But forbidden for you is the game of land while you are in pilgrim sanctity. And fear God, to Whom you will be gathered. - 5:96
