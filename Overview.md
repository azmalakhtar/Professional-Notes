In Kotlin, everything is an object in the sense that you can call member functions and properties on any variable. While certain types have an optimized internal representation as primitive values, they appear and behave like regular classes to you.

Basic types used in Kotlin are:
- Numbers and their unsigned counterparts
- Booleans
- Characters
- Strings
- Arrays
