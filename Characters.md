Characters are represented by the type `Char`. Character literals go in single quotes: `'1'`.

On the JVM, a character stored as primitive type: char, represents a 16-bit Unicode character. Characters are boxed in Java classes when a nullable reference is needed.

Special characters start from an escaping backslash `\`.
